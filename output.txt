Hi Mike,

As the founder of Mountain Goat Software, I'm curious to know how you're leveraging agile methodologies to streamline your own business operations, particularly in scaling your live online training courses and mentoring services.

Having worked in AI for customer support for several years, I know firsthand how challenging it can be to streamline customer interactions.
But when done right, it can make a huge difference in efficiency and customer satisfaction.

I've developed AI solutions that transform customer support processes and help companies handle customer inquiries more effectively.
If you're curious about how this can work for you, I'd be glad to share more.

If interested, just shoot me a reply.

Thanks, Aymen
